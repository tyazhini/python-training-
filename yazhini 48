There Lucy and Tina play a game. In this game, there are three boxes with some number written on their top. There is a treasure in one of the three boxes and the treasure is present in the box with the second largest number on its top. Also, to open the box, they need to decode the correct code of this box. The clue given to them to find the code is that it is the largest number which divides all the three given numbers.So, now help Lucy and Tina to decode the code.
