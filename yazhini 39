Sanjay wants to know whether the user input is Automorphic number or not.

For example,

    The Automorphic number is square of the number ends with the Same number. 
    Square of 5 is 25,its ends with the value of 5.
    so the number 5 is Automorphic Number.
could you please help him to find it and implements in program.
